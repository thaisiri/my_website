Hi, My name is Thaisiri Siripoorikan. I was born and raised in Thailand, one of the most beautiful countries in the world. I am 26 years old and counting! Currently, I am studying an MBA program at LBS(London Business School). Prior to the MBA, I have been working at PTT, which is one of the largest energy company in Thailand!

One of the project I was working at PTT is "Swap & Go", a new electric vehicle enterprise that focuses on battery swapping services. Historically, PTT – Thailand’s largest energy company – had focused primarily on oil and gas. However, rapidly changing global trends indicate sustainability issues in the oil industry. Consequently, PTT must diversify and stay ahead of current trends by driving alternative energy. As a result, we tried to shift to a new trend and develop new businesses that are related to technology and energy.
